== Overview

A *reporter* is used by gateway and management API instances to report many types of event:

* Administration metrics : administrative tasks (CRUD on resources)
* Authentication / Authorization metrics: (Sign-in activity, Sign-up activity)

By default, a default reporter is created using MongoDB or JDBC implementation according to the backend configured into the gravitee.yaml file.

Since AM 3.6, it is possible to create additional reporters. 

== File Reporter
 
This implementation is a "File" based reporter to write events into a dedicated file. It may be useful if you want to ingest event into a thirdparty system.

=== Configuration

File reporters are configurable into the gravitee.yaml file under the `reporter` section with the following properties:

|===
|property | type | required | description 

|enabled
|boolean
|N
|boolean to enable globally the reporters (default: false)

|directory
|string
|N
|Path to the directory where files will be created, this directory has to exist (default: ${gravitee.home}/reporter-logs/)

|output
|string
|N
|Format used to export event. Possible values: JSON, MESSAGE_PACK, ELASTICSEARCH, CSV
|===
